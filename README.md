### Questions:

1. What is the Single Responsibility Principle? What's its purpose?

- It's a principle which states that every class/function in a program should encapsulate the responsibility over a single part of that program functionality. It's highest purpose is to easily manipulate and maintains components/classes/function and minimize errors because it keeps the class/function focused on a single concern.

2. What characteristics does a "good" code or clean code have?

- Good code must be ordered, commented, generated with good programming practices, trying to be as explicit as possible so that someone else can read it.
